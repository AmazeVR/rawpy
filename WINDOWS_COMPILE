First, read appveyor/run_with_env.cmd and see which Windows SDK (contains the compiler)
you need to install.

Open a command shell, and set the following variables depending on which Python you use:

set PYTHON_VERSION=2.7 # or 3.3 or 3.4 or 3.5
set PYTHON_ARCH=32 # or 64

Then you can compile with:

cmd /E:ON /V:ON /C .\appveyor\run_with_env.cmd python setup.py bdist_wheel
